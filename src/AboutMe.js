        <p>
        Hello there! I'm Pavan Bagwe, a passionate Computer Science enthusiast currently in the final semester of my BSc CS journey. <br/><br/> With a strong foundation in React, SQL databases, and backend development using Node.js and Express, I thrive on turning innovative ideas into robust and scalable web applications. <br/>
        <br/>
        My expertise extends to mobile app development, where I've delved into the world of React Native for cross-platform applications and honed my skills in Android app development using Kotlin. <br/><br/>

        One of my key strengths lies in my proficiency in data structures and algorithms, allowing me to architect efficient and optimized solutions to complex problems. I believe that a solid technical foundation is the cornerstone of great software, and I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible through continuous learning and exploration.
