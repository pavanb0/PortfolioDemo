        <p>
        Hello there! I'm Pavan Bagwe, a passionate Computer Science enthusiast<br/><br/>
        With a Strong Foundation in Full-Stack development with .Net Framework and AngularFramework I thrive on turning innovative ideas into robust and scalable applications. <br/>
        <br/>
        My expertise extends to mobile app development, where I've delved into the world of React Native for cross-platform applications and honed my skills in Android app development using Kotlin. <br/><br/>

        One of my key strengths lies in my proficiency in data structures and algorithms, allowing me to architect efficient and optimized solutions to complex problems. 
        I believe that a solid technical foundation is the cornerstone of great software, and I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible through continuous learning and exploration.
